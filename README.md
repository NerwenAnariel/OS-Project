# OS-Project
Java codes for FCFS, SJF, SRT and Round Robin algorithms.

## The Runnable Files:
- FirstComeFirstServe.java
- ShortestJobFirst.java
- ShortestRemainingTime.java
- RoundRobin.java

## Completed Codes:

- [x] FCFS
- [ ] SJF
- [ ] SRT
- [ ] RR

## How The Inputs Should Be: (For All Codes uploaded.)

- The first line of input must be _the name of the processes_, each name separated by a space from the other. 

##### Example:
```
A B C
```

- The second line of input must be _the arrival times of the processes_, each number separated by a space from the other. 

##### Example:
```
2 0 3
```

- Finally, the third line of the input must be _the burst times of the processes_, again each separated by a space from the other. 

##### Example: 
```
4 5 3
```
## Outputs:

The first three lines are for (in order) FCFS, SJF and SRT. The 4 following lines belong to RR.

##### Example (Only FCFS until full completion of the project):

```
BBBBBAAAACCC
```
